I'm a **technical product leader** building expressive APIs, scalable systems, and thoughtful tools at the intersection of product strategy and engineering.

💡 I work like a systems engineer with a product brain — merging **retro-tech inspiration** with modern **AI workflows**, blockchain trust layers, and design-first APIs.

📚 I write, prototype, and ship. Clients like Siemens, Vertex, and Tata Communications use what I build.

## 🏢 Enterprise-Ready Thinking

I work closely with enterprise teams to build platforms that scale — technically, operationally, and strategically.

🔹 **Enterprise Design Thinking**: I simplify complexity, reduce technical debt, and align product architecture with business models.  
🔹 **API-as-a-Product Philosophy**: Every API I design is a contract with the business — documented, durable, and intuitive.  
🔹 **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: I bridge engineering, product, and leadership teams to drive outcomes over output.  
🔹 **Strategic Systems**: I build not just features, but primitives — systems that other systems can build on.

### ✨ On the Creative Side

Beyond code, I write **speculative fiction** and build **mythic systems** like **BrahmaScript** and **Māyāforge**, where stories and protocols intersect. My creative work blends **AI, worldbuilding, and narrative systems** — exploring how imagination can shape better technology.

---

### 🧬 Design Philosophy

I believe building systems and building stories are two sides of the same design coin.

---

### 📖 Publications

I occasionally publish essays, world notes, and narrative experiments at **System Signal Blog**.

## 💼 Thinking of working together?

Enterprises looking to build expressive systems, adopt protocol thinking, or scale next-gen products — I bring:

✅ A rare mix of **deep engineering insight** and **strategic product leadership**  
✅ Experience with **blockchain, AI, and platform-scale systems**  
✅ A mindset that values **clarity, autonomy, and long-term thinking**
