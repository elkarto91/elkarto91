# 👋 Hey, I'm Karthik Mohan

**System Design · Enterprise Architecture · Product Strategy**  
AVP – Products • Member, IEI (Institution of Engineers India)  
MBA in AI for Business (BITS Pilani, in progress) • B.E. Information Science

I'm a technical product leader who builds **expressive APIs**, **scalable systems**, and **trust-first platforms** at the intersection of **architecture and product**.  
I work like a **systems engineer with a product brain** — merging retro-tech inspiration with modern **AI workflows**, **blockchain trust layers**, and **design-first APIs**.

I write, prototype, and ship. **Clients like Siemens, Vertex, and Tata Communications** use what I build.

## 🔧 Featured Projects

- **📡 Operary** — Signal-based coordination engine for clean, verifiable backends.  
- **🧠 Neuralic** — AI governance stack for auditability, lineage, and explainability.  
- **✍️ System Signal** — Essays on clarity, systems, and protocol-driven thinking.  
- **🧰 Strategy Templates** — Real-world PM & GTM playbooks.  
- **📐 Architecture Gallery** — Snapshots of systems I’ve led and scaled.

## 🧠 Focus Areas

- **System Design & AI Engineering (Generalist)**
- **First-Principles Product Thinking**
- **Enterprise Experience (EX) & API Craftsmanship**
- **SaaS, Web3/Blockchain, and Trust Protocols**
- **Writing to clarify systems and strategy**

---

## 🏢 Enterprise-Ready Thinking

I partner with enterprise teams to build platforms that **scale technically, operationally, and strategically**.

- **Enterprise Architecture:** TOGAF-inspired roadmaps, **LeanIX** portfolio & risk governance, ArchiMate modeling.  
- **Enterprise Design Thinking:** Simplify complexity, reduce technical debt, align architecture with business models.  
- **API-as-a-Product:** Every API is a business contract — documented, durable, intuitive.  
- **Cross-Functional Leadership:** Bridge engineering, product, and exec teams to drive **outcomes over output**.  
- **Strategic Systems:** Not just features — **primitives and platforms** other systems can build on.  
- **Product Ops:** OKRs, KPIs, JTBD, RACI/DACI, discovery→delivery at scale.

## ✨ On the Creative Side

I write speculative fiction and build mythic systems like **BrahmaScript** and **Māyāforge**, where stories and protocols intersect — blending **AI**, **worldbuilding**, and **narrative systems** to sharpen real-world design.

**Design Philosophy:** Building systems and building stories are two sides of the same design coin.

## 📖 Publications

- **System Signal** — essays & case studies: https://systemsignal.dev/  
- System Signal Blog on **Notion** — narrative experiments & notes

## 💼 Thinking of working together?

Enterprises looking to build expressive systems, adopt protocol thinking, or scale next-gen products — I bring:

- ✅ A rare mix of **deep engineering** insight and **strategic product leadership**  
- ✅ Experience with **blockchain, AI, and platform-scale** systems  
- ✅ A mindset that values **clarity, autonomy, and long-term thinking**
